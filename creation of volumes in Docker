TO create volumes in a docker there are 3 ways 
  1. USING DOCKER FILE
  2. CREATE A VOLUME WHILE CREATE CONTAINER USING COMMAND
  3. CREATING A LOCAL VOLUME AND MOUNT IT TO THE CONTAINER
1.USING DOCKER FILE:
          Docker file is using to create a volume, after creating docker file build the Image, using image creating container and also remeber that Docker file and Components are
starting letters are Capital letters(upper cases), and components are in Docker file : FROM and VOLUME .
FROM: in this component will be in Dockerfile only image will be built.
VOLUME: it is component will be created volume and create container after this container will be provide in["/"]place in inside double codes.
after creating this file exicute command to build image using docker file [ docker build -it image name]
now create container using build image [docker run -it -d --name contname -p 81:80 imgname]
now go in to the container exec command and go to root directory there use command 'ls' and u will see the created volume as a directory as shown.
2.CREATE A VOLUME WHILE CREATE CONTAINER USING COMMAND:
                   in this method we use a simple command to create avolume using required base image [docker run -it -d --name cont1 -v/volume2 httpd]
after executing command and go inside container using exec command and go to root directory there use command'ls' you will see the created volume as adirectory.
3. CREATING A LOCAL VOLUME AND MOUNT IT TO THE CONTAINER:
                      in this method first we create a local volume using the command[docker volume create volume4]
after that exicute the below command to mount the created volume and container.
[docker run -it -d --name cont3 --mount source=volume4,destination=/volume4 ubuntu]
after exicuting command go in the container using exec command and go to root directory there is command 'ls' u will see the created volume as a directory shown
